## USBNinja

This is a program I wrote in 2007 to detect and eject USB devices based on either or both the Vendor or ID. This could be configured via Group Policy templates, which I also wrote.

The purpose was to prevent data exfiltration via USB drives, or malware infection via USB drives...all of which seemed novel back in 2006/2007.

The code worked across a large enterprise on Windows 2000, XP, and Windows Vista.
